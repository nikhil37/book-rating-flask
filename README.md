# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


This project was a simple book rating website.

The "import.py" was run to create the database.

". set-flask.txt" need to run before runnunf the flask application itself.

goodreadsapikey contains the API key used in the project.

Once everything is set up, you can start the web server by using the command "flask run".

I've user an online API to get the Images of the books, this might make the site slower if you don't know what yopu are looking for.# multi-vendor-ecommerce
